# Stroke_risk_prediction_project

This project was carried out as part of the 3rd Year 1st Semester coursework for the Fundamentals of Data Mining module in the BSc. (Hons) in Information Technology specializing in Data Science.

With changing lifestyles, health risks, early detection of stroke likelihood has become a critical need in modern healthcare.

Medical practitioners and healthcare organizations often face challenges in assessing the probability of stroke due to multiple interrelated risk factors such as age, hypertension, smoking, and glucose levels. Manual assessment can be slow, less consistent, and resource intensive.

To address this issue, our team designed an intelligent software solution that leverages data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the risk of stroke. This predictive system provides an opportunity for timely medical consultation, lifestyle adjustment, and preventive care, thereby helping reduce potential complications.

Our solution, called Stroke Riskometer, is an interactive application that enables users to input their health and lifestyle information to receive an estimated risk score. It aims to assist both individuals and healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions and promoting awareness about stroke prevention.
